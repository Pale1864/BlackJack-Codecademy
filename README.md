# BlackJack-Codecademy
Black Jack program for Codecademy final project

This is a simple black jack game made for a final project in the computer science career path on Codecademy.
It will be a one-player game pitting you against the deal with a single deck.
You and the dealer will be given two cards but you will only be able to see one of the dealers cards.
You will then be given the option to 'hit', that is to recieve another card, 'stay', and 'split' (only if the two cards are of the same kind).
This will continue until you decide to 'stay' on a value or you bust by going over the value of 21.
The dealer will then show their hidden card and continue dealing himself cards until he reaches a value higher than 17. If this value is greater than yours but less than or equal to 21, you lose. But if the dealer busts or total card value is less than yours, you win!
